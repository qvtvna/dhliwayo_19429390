                                   This particular rtack was made as an open collaboration, facilitated
                                   by the producer, "Lxmitless." First part of the track from 0:00-1:07 was
                                   produced by him, and I took part in the rest of the track form then onward.
                                   Background visuals feature a snippet of the Anime show, "七つの大罪(Nanatsu no Taizai)."

                                   this year. Currently sits at 18 views, with 3 likes. With this track, I used a sample of the song
                                   "Purple Avenue" by Colors of June as the main melody, and layered a series of my own drum patterns
                                   on top of it. The name represents the mood I felt when I listened to the original sample.

                               it, which just happened to be 00:44. I used 2 samples from the song "Call On Me" by Johnny Hammond, the first appearing
                               from 00:00-01:50, and the next appearing from 01:50 until the end, with both of these acting as the main melody, accompanied
                               by layered drum patterns done by me.
